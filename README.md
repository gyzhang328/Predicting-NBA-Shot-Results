# Predicting-NBA-Shot-Results

A General Assembly Capstone Project (also my own hooby project) - to conduct analysis on NBA shots taken from 2014-2015 regular season. Using different machine learning model, I seek to predict the shot results.

## Project Summary

Problem Statement:
All NBA teams want to maximize the value of each possession, a.k.a maximize the chance of making each shot (apparently I guess). So can we predict the results of shots? Or in other words, can we evaluate the quality of NBA shots?

I used a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is scraped from NBA REST's API. For further details, please refer: https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs

I started off the project by cleaning and understanding the dataset. Then, I performed detailed exploratory data analysis to understand all the features within the dataset.

Before applying machine learning model, I performed certain variable transformation as welll feature engineering. I used Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors as well as Random Forest to conduct shot classification on the training sets.

Finally, I used the best model to predict shots result in the testing set.

Code used in this project - Python.
